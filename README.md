# ⚛️ Reactor Safety - ML Experiments  

Just a collection of scripts and experiments related to **reactor safety analysis**. Mostly playing around with **LER (Licensee Event Reports)**, classification, and visualization.

## 📂 What's Inside?
- `crawl_LER.py` – Scrapes LER data  
- `classify_LER.py` – Classifies reports based on causes  
- `relation_classification.py` – Tests relationships in event data  
- `visualize_classification.py` – Some basic visualization  
- `filtered_LER_reports.csv` – Processed report data  

This repo is more of a **sandbox** than a structured project. 🚧
