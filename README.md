# Reactor_safety

This repository contains Python scripts and resources to analyze and visualize the process and countermeasures related to a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) in nuclear reactors.

## Overview

The repository focuses on analyzing reactor safety data, particularly in the context of LOCA events, and visualizing key factors such as causes, effects, and countermeasures. The goal is to offer a clear representation of how LOCA unfolds and how various safety measures can mitigate the accident.

## Repository Structure

- `__pycache__/`: Cache files generated by Python, typically ignored by Git.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies the files and directories to ignore in this repository.
- `README.md`: Provides a detailed overview of the project.
- `environment.yml`: Contains the environment configuration for the project, useful for recreating the environment using `conda`.
- `gpt_ex.py`: Test code for generating LOCA-related texts using GPT for safety visualization purposes.
- `lda.py`: Implements topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify relevant topics from the LOCA documents.
- `tf_idf.py`: Extracts key terms using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) from the LOCA data.
- `vis_wordcloud.py`: Generates visualizations, such as word clouds, to represent important terms in LOCA-related documents.

## Data

The reactor safety documents related to LOCA are stored in the `data/` folder. These documents are analyzed and categorized into various sections, including causes, effects, and countermeasures.

## Scripts

The following scripts are included in the repository:

- **LDA Analysis (`lda.py`)**: Uses LDA for topic modeling to extract and group key terms from the LOCA documents.
- **TF-IDF Analysis (`tf_idf.py`)**: Applies TF-IDF to highlight the most important terms in the reactor safety documents.
- **Visualization (`vis_wordcloud.py`)**: Generates word clouds and other visual representations to display important LOCA-related keywords.
- **GPT Experiment (`gpt_ex.py`)**: Includes experimental code using GPT to assist with text-based generation and classification of safety-related keywords and concepts.

## Environment Setup

To set up the environment, use the `environment.yml` file with `conda`:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate reactor_safety
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/separk-1/Reactor_safety.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Reactor_safety
```

3. Ensure that the necessary data files are in the `data/` directory.

4. Run the scripts as needed for analysis or visualization. For example:

```bash
python lda.py
```
